### Goal: Create a personal Express app that has two or more CRUD features.

### Process:

<ol>
  <liThis one put me thru the ringer and I mean that.</li>
  <li>Originally, I had thought that we were creating an API, so when I found out that I had spent my entire Thursday building the wrong project, I almost ran into a wall.<li>
  <li>I did put this project down and return to it at the end right before starting another project's layout, but my solve was simple.</li>
  <li>All I did, was stick the body of my index.html file into the body of the profile.ejs and boom--now we're cooking.</li>
   <li>All of the code for retrieving from my animal database was there.  The user would enter an initial and it would place three animals from my database with the names that started with that initial into the DOM.</li>  
   <li>I had written code that had fetched from the server, so I moved that to main.js and rewrote the code so it would pull from the API that was now moved to that same main.js.</li>
  <li>The next step was setting up my CRUD methods--a post, put, and delete.  Easy, the use can already sign up and log in due to the boiler plate I was using, so all I had left to do was to make a message board so that people can comment on their favorite animals, upvote or downvote a post, or even remove their comment.</li>
  <li>Done and dusted.</li>

<p>Overall, I am so happy with how quickly I was able to reconfigure this app.  I was so upset because originally I had spent my entire day trying to get the project to pull the server-side when that was not even the goal of my assignment...  Oh, em gee.  I am proud of myself, though.  I really spun that 'L' into a 'W' and I think that's what coding is all about.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 5 <em>My CRUDs are in there; check 'em and see.</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 5 <em>It's really amazing how much you can get done with this app when you understand it.  Slowly, but surely, I'm getting there.</em></li>
</ul>
